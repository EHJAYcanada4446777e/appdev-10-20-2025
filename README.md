# How to Submit Your Project

To contribute your activity, you must **Fork** this repository and then create a **Pull Request**. Follow these steps carefully.

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

First, you need to create a personal copy (a "fork") of this repository.

1.  On the top-right of this GitHub page, click the **Fork** button.
    
2.  This will create a new copy of the project under your own GitHub account (e.g., `your-username/appdev-10-20-2025`).

## Step 2: Clone Your Fork

Now, clone the repository *from your account* to your local computer.

1.  Go to **your forked repository's page** (not the original one).
2.  Click the green **Code** button and copy the **HTTPS URL**. It should look like this:
    > `https://github.com/your-username/appdev-10-20-2025.git`
3.  Open your terminal, navigate to where you want to save your project, and run:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/appdev-10-20-2025.git](https://github.com/your-username/appdev-10-20-2025.git)
    ```
4.  Enter the new project directory:
    ```bash
    cd appdev-10-20-2025
    ```

## Step 3: Add Your Project Files

Now you can add your group's activity.

1.  Inside the `appdev-10-20-2025` folder, create a **new folder** with your group name and surnames.
    > Example: `group9-Izuku-Bakugo`
2.  Move all your project files (e.g., `.html`, `.css`, `.js`) into this new folder.

## Step 4: Commit and Push Your Changes

Save your work and push it to *your fork* on GitHub.

1.  In your terminal, add your new folder to Git:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
2.  Commit your changes with a meaningful message:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add Group 9 (Izuku, Bakugo) activity"
    ```
3.  Push your commit to **your fork** (this will work because you own it):
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

## Step 5: Open a Pull Request

The final step is to send your changes to the main project for review.

1.  Go to your forked repository on the GitHub website.
2.  You should see a banner that says "This branch is 1 commit ahead of `johnlouie-navales:main`."
3.  Click the **Contribute** button, then click **Open pull request**.
    
4.  On the next page, review your changes and click the **Create pull request** button.

Et voilà! You’ve just submitted your activity for review!
